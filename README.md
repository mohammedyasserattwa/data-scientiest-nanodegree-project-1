# Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
Welcome to the first project of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree repository! This project focuses on how retrieve information from a dataset. How to retrieve questions from the dataset and how to use the dataset in order to provide solutions to those questions. 
## Overview
The most important step and the first one is to pick the dataset. The dataset chosen is the StackOverflow Survey 2022 Dataset [1] . The next step is to generate questions that can be solved using the dataset. Then, we prepare the data by getting rid of unwanted columns from the dataset in order to gather the data necessary to answer the questions. If there is any categorical or missing data, it should be handled in that step too. Next is to analyse, model, and visualize the results.
## Questions
These are the questions that will be solved using the dataset:
1.  What are the most preferred/wanted programming languages in Egypt?
2.  What are the actual languages that these respondents work with in Egypt?
3.  How is the utilization of programming languages at work connected to the programming languages that individuals aspire to work with in Egypt?
